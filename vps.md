Here’s a clear and structured English markdown summary of your VPS architecture, deployment workflow, and management design for your Nginx + Docker + Certbot setup:

# VPS Architecture and Multi-Project Management

## DNS & Subdomains

- **Wildcard DNS**: All subdomains (*.yourdomain.com) are directed to your VPS IP.
- **Automatic Resolution**: Any new subdomain (e.g., `projectA.yourdomain.com`, `projectB.yourdomain.com`, `buy.cute.org`, `meme.cute.org`, `www.cute.org`) resolves instantly—no further DNS changes required.

## Nginx Reverse Proxy

- **Single Nginx Instance**: One Nginx server listens on port 80 (HTTP) for all incoming subdomains.
- **Reverse Proxying**: Nginx routes subdomains to different projects/services running on unique internal ports.

### Example Nginx Config
```nginx
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name projectA.yourdomain.com;
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
  }
}

server {
  listen 80;
  server_name projectB.yourdomain.com;
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:4000;
  }
}

server {
  listen 80;
  server_name buy.cute.org;
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
  }
}

server {
  listen 80;
  server_name meme.cute.org;
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3002;
  }
}

server {
  listen 80;
  server_name www.cute.org;
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
  }
}
```

Each block maps a domain to a backend service on a different port.

## Dockerized Projects

- **Isolated Containers**: Every project (website/app) runs in its own Docker container, using a dedicated port (`projectA:3001`, `projectB:4000`, `meme:3002`, etc.).
- **Directories**: Store each project in a separate path, e.g., `/srv/projects/projectA`, `/srv/projects/projectB`, etc.
- **Flexible Stack**: Projects can use any framework or language—there are no dependency clashes.

## HTTPS with Let's Encrypt (Certbot)

- **Automatic TLS**: Use Certbot to issue and renew certificates for all (sub)domains, including new ones.
- **Managed Security**: Certbot integrates with Nginx, ensuring all sites are HTTPS-secured.

## Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for New Projects

1. **Create Project**: Scaffold a new project with a `Dockerfile` for your preferred stack.
2. **Assign Port & Configure Nginx**: Pick an unused port, update the Nginx config for the domain + port mapping.
3. **Deploy & Start**: Use `docker-compose up -d` for your project’s directory.
4. **Reload Nginx**: Run `nginx -s reload` (or `systemctl reload nginx`) to apply changes.
5. **Certbot TLS Update**: Certbot will automatically include new subdomains in the TLS certificate.

## Management & Scaling Tips

- **docker-compose**: Manage each project’s lifecycle separately—start, stop, and update without affecting others.
- **Logs**: Store multitenant project logs in `/var/log/projects/projectA/` etc.
- **Scaling**: Add new sites/services simply by deploying a new Docker container and one Nginx block.
- **Portainer/Kubernetes (Advanced)**: For complex setups, consider tools like Portainer for Docker management or Kubernetes for orchestration.

## Benefits Overview

- **Tech stack freedom** for every project
- **Easy scaling/addition** of projects with minimal configuration
- **Complete project isolation**, no dependency conflicts
- **Centralized management** via Nginx and Certbot
- **Streamlined HTTPS** for all subdomains

**Summary:**  
This VPS + Docker + Nginx + Certbot setup provides isolated, easily managed, and secure multi-project hosting with maximum tech stack flexibility and minimal operational effort. Adding new projects is streamlined: just create a container, add an Nginx config, and reload!
